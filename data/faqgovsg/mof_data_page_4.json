The Government is in a strong reserves position, i.e. its assets far exceed its liabilities (CPF liabilities in the form of SSGS are a part of these liabilities). The strong reserves position can be seen from the investment returns that are made available for spending on the Government Budget or Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC).

The NIRC is drawn from returns on assets in excess of the liabilities, not gross assets. (For more information, see summary under Our Nation's Reserves, Section II.) It should be further noted that, as stipulated in the Constitution, the NIRC recorded in the Government Budget only comprises up to 50% of the expected returns on the reserves. The NIRC figures are submitted to the Presidents Office and audited by the Auditor-Generals Office.<br><br></p><p>c.
