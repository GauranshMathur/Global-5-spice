The app takes into account the operating hours, restrictions, parking scheme, and tariff rate of each car park to automatically calculate the parking charges. If a car park has an overnight parking scheme, the parking charges will be capped once the parking duration exceeds the overnight parking rate. However, please note that you cannot park at a car park during restricted periods. For example, many HDB car parks are reserved for Season Ticket holders only between 10pm to 7am the following morning.
