Parties will explain their issues in conflict. The mediator will facilitate the discussion and help parties negotiate possible options. At times, the mediator may speak to parties privately to understand issues in depth. Once parties are able to agree on mutually acceptable solutions, the mediator will put these terms into an agreement. Parties will sign the agreement. The agreement is binding on the signed parties. If parties cannot come to an agreement, the mediation will come to a close.
