She may have done better than expected but she must remain committed tot he DSA school in which she has accepted a place. In the same way, the DSA school is committed to its offer of a place to the student so long as she qualifies for secondary education in the 'Express stream'. Applications for a transfer will only be considered if there are extenuating circumstances that prevent a student from fulfilling her DSA commitment after she has accepted a place (e.g. a permanent injury that she sustained after accepting a place in her choice DSA school via a sport, and where it is medically deemed that she cannot fulfil her commitment to play the sport after that).","updatedAt":"2023-06-15T10:47:23.973Z","numPositiveFeedback":0},"topics":[{"id":207,"title":"Direct School Admission - Specific Talents","priority":0,"agencyId":"clix0hpwh0000mo08qv6qi2xi","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null}],"agency":{"code":"rgs","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/rgs.png"}},{"id":"clix0o9jw002wmo08r7hctkot","title":"When will the PSLE results be released?","body":null,"createdAt":"2023-06-15T10:47:23.973Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-06-15T10:47:23.973Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"clix0o9jw002xmo08f9mienqm","body":"Usually in late November.","updatedAt":"2023-06-15T10:47:23.973Z","numPositiveFeedback":0},"topics":[{"id":208,"title":"PSLE Posting","priority":0,"agencyId":"clix0hpwh0000mo08qv6qi2xi","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null}],"agency":{"code":"rgs","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/rgs.png"}},{"id":"clix0o9jx002zmo08wfdxz9tz","title":"When does a student need to choose her secondary schools?
