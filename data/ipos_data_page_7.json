Your use of such artwork depends on what was agreed between your company and the graphics designer on the use of the artwork and/or ownership of copyright in the artwork.\n\nIf there was no agreement on this issue, the default position is that the graphics designer, although commissioned by you, (or his company, if he is an employee) owns the copyright to the artwork. You should only \"recycle\" the designs with permission as this involves making copies of the artwork. Even though the event details will be changed, a substantial part of the artwork would have been copied and this is enough to infringe copyright.\n\nIn general, it is best to ensure at the outset that the terms of the engagement suit your company's needs. This must be agreed between both parties in writing. \n\n","updatedAt":"2023-04-18T07:27:29.190Z","numPositiveFeedback":0},"topics":[{"id":28,"title":"Copyright (At Work)","priority":0,"agencyId":"clglxvay900b0l408s009s4jx","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null}],"agency":{"code":"ipos","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/ipos.png"}},{"id":"clglxzrrt00ebl408n8b598x7","title":"Can I request for a refund for a fee for an application or form?","body":null,"createdAt":"2023-04-18T07:27:29.190Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-04-18T07:27:29.190Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"clglxzrrt00ecl40891jcptoa","body":"<p>Refund may be allowed under the following list of circumstances:<br><br>- You made duplicate payment for a form. <br>- You filed duplicate forms. <br>- You submitted a form which cannot be processed. <br><br>A refund request can be submitted via <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://digitalhub.ipos.gov.sg/\">IPOS Digital Hub</a>.
