You can either obtain permission directly from the copyright owner, or obtain a licence from the relevant collective management organisation (\u201cCMO\u201d) managing the relevant rights in those works.

This would include sheet music written by composers who have died more than 70 years ago. <br>Even where a particular work has entered the public domain, there can still be copyright protection over sound recordings of that work being performed. In such a situation, the musical work itself may be in the public domain and free to use (e.g., the sheet music) but the specific sound recording of a particular musician performing that work may still be copyright-protected (i.e., you would need to obtain permission or a licence to play that specific sound recording in your class). <br>You may refer to the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.ipos.gov.sg/docs/default-source/resources-library/copyright/copyright-101-infopack.pdf\">Copyright Infopack</a> for more details on the above."}]}
