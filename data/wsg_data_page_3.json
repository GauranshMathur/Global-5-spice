WSG officers will NOT ask for your Singpass or iBanking userids and passwords.<br/></li>\n<li>Stay vigilant and only click on links from trusted sources. Always log in to your account from the official WSG websites. To determine if a link will lead you to a malicious website or is reliable, you can hover your mouse over the link to view the\n        full address. For mobile devices, you can hold your finger down on the link so that a window pops out and shows you the full address of the link.</li>\n<li>Verify the sender:\n        <br/>- For email, ensure that the sender’s email address is correctly spelt and ends with @wsg.gov.sg or @ssg-wsg.gov.sg.<br/>- For SMS, ensure that the sender is either from “WSG” or “WSG and e2i”. We will not\n        send SMS from other IDs.<br/>- Telephone calls from WSG officers to you will not begin with a prefix \"+65\". If a call has a prefix with a plus (+) sign, it is likely to be an overseas call. </li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"margin-left: 30px\">\n<li>Messages from WSG may contain links to the WSG website or other Government websites.
