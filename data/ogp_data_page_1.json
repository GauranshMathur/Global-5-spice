OGP’s mission is threefold: <br><br>(1) Experiment on these best practices (from how we build tech products, the technologies we use, to how we run hiring, compensation, career tracks) in the public sector domain. <br>(2) Demonstrate what works in the public sector domain on projects and things which matter e.g. nationwide systems and products. <br>(3) Propagate these products and best practices to the rest of government, so that over time, we’re doing tech for public good well across the whole government. <br><br>OGP reports directly to GovTech and Smart Nation senior management, ie, our supervisory panel. We retain our own product ownership, run our own product teams, and have our own HR systems and practices.</p>","updatedAt":"2023-04-18T03:43:51.805Z","numPositiveFeedback":40},"topics":[{"id":15,"title":"About OGP","priority":0,"agencyId":"clglpwyl90000l608f0aejm01","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null}],"agency":{"code":"ogp","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/ogpcareers.png"}},{"id":"clglq06pq0005l608mq4dyeb8","title":"What do you look out for when hiring new product managers?","body":"I would like to find out more about the product manager role","createdAt":"2023-04-18T03:43:51.805Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-08-15T06:48:17.856Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"clglq06pq0006l608sh3xxegp","body":"<p>In general, we look for people who show strong ability in the field they’re applying for, who care about tech for public good, who are strong communicators, and who take the initiative to make things happen. <br><br>We look more at demonstrated experience (e.g. side projects) than academic qualifications or specific degrees. <br><br>For product managers - we’re looking at candidates who show an entrepreneurial drive for public good. <br><br>An ideal candidate is one who shows tech know-how (understanding software engineering concepts, background in coding), good product sense in deriving product vision and road maps, and initiative.</p>","updatedAt":"2023-08-15T06:48:17.739Z","numPositiveFeedback":15},"topics":[{"id":11,"title":"Product Manager","priority":0,"agencyId":"clglpwyl90000l608f0aejm01","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null}],"agency":{"code":"ogp","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/ogpcareers.png"}},{"id":"clglq06pq000ql608qznquv35","title":"What are the current working arrangements (wfh / in-office)?","body":"Would like to know if OGP allows Work From Home or solely work from office?","createdAt":"2023-04-18T03:43:51.805Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-04-18T03:43:51.805Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"clglq06pr000rl608p774tvvf","body":"<p>We are flexible and leave this to the employee.
