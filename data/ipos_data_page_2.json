Such Applications WITHOUT Claim(s) (hereafter called \"Aw/oC\") can be seen as \"provisional\". This Aw/oC approach would be attractive to some applicants who are not yet ready to furnish any patent claims at the time of filing their application.\n\n\n\nUpon filing an Aw/oC, the applicant must furnish one or more patent claims with IPOS within the prescribed period of 12 months from the date of filing. When this occurs, the Aw/oC is \"converted\" into a complete patent application with claim(s), and it can then proceed further in the application process. The date of filing accorded to the Aw/oC is retained even after \"conversion\" as it is still the same application [albeit with claim(s) after \"conversion\"]. This is significant as the term of a patent begins from its date of filing. In the event that no patent claims are furnished within the period prescribed, the Aw/oC shall be treated as having been abandoned, and the 12 months timeline from the date of filing to file claims is non-extendable.\n\n\n\nIf an Aw/oC is the first filing of the invention in question, the applicant may decide, within 12 months from the date of filing of that Aw/oC, to file an Application WITH CLAIM(s) (hereafter called \"AWC\") in a Paris Convention or WTO country for the same invention and claim priority based on the \"Aw/oC\". In such an application, the date of filing accorded to the AWC is not that of the Aw/oC, the applicant benefits from the priority claim based on the \"Aw/oC\" application and the patent term of 20 years starts from the date of filing of the \"AWC\", provided the legal requirements are met.\n\n\n\n","updatedAt":"2023-04-18T07:27:29.190Z","numPositiveFeedback":1},"topics":[{"id":26,"title":"Patents","priority":0,"agencyId":"clglxvay900b0l408s009s4jx","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null}],"agency":{"code":"ipos","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/ipos.png"}},{"id":"clglxzrrv00fhl408d8go7602","title":"Can I use scene(s) from movies in my presentations?","body":null,"createdAt":"2023-04-18T07:27:29.190Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2023-04-18T07:27:29.190Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"clglxzrrv00fil408qv5a8juv","body":"<p>Owning an original movie DVD or having a video on demand subscription service allows you to enjoy the movie privately in a domestic setting.
