All Singaporeans aged 25 and above will receive an opening SFC of $500 (“Opening SFC”). The opening credit will not expire and individuals can use their credit for a range of eligible courses listed on the MySkillsFuture portal.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">On 1 October 2020, the Government provided a one-off SFC top-up of $500 for all eligible Singaporeans aged 25 or above by 31 December 2020. Termed the “One-Off SkillsFuture Credit Top-Up”, these credits will expire on 31 December 2025. At the same time, the Government also provided Singaporeans aged 40 to 60 (inclusive) as of 31 December 2020 an additional $500 credit [“Additional SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career Support)” which will also expire on 31 December 2025].</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">From 1 May 2024, the Government will provide Singaporeans aged 40 and above an additional $4,000 credit (“SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career)”). At the same time, the Government lifted the expiry date of the Additional SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career Support), i.e., it will not expire when it reaches its maturity date on 31 December 2025. The remaining credit balance from the Additional SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career Support) will merge with the top-up of $4,000 to form the new SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career).</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">For example, if you are an individual aged 40 and above as of 1 May 2024, if you have used $300 from your Additional SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career Support) account, your balance of $200 will be brought over to your new SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career) account. Therefore, you will see a total of $4,200 in your SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career).<br/>\n </p>","updatedAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.602Z","numPositiveFeedback":0},"topics":[{"id":857,"title":"SkillsFuture Credit","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null},{"id":1466,"title":"Purpose & Objective","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":857,"parentTopic":{"title":"SkillsFuture Credit"}}],"agency":{"code":"skillsfuture","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/skillsfuture.png"}},{"id":"cluhzew8g0049s7ne0q76rzqg","title":"Which government agency is handling SkillsFuture Credit (SFC)?","body":null,"createdAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.602Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.253Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"cluhzew8g004as7nemm6piycq","body":"<p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">SFC is administered by SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG).<br/>\n </p>","updatedAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.602Z","numPositiveFeedback":0},"topics":[{"id":857,"title":"SkillsFuture Credit","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null},{"id":1466,"title":"Purpose & Objective","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":857,"parentTopic":{"title":"SkillsFuture Credit"}}],"agency":{"code":"skillsfuture","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/skillsfuture.png"}},{"id":"cluhzew8g004bs7neef44xdus","title":"What is the SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme about and what does it include?","body":null,"createdAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.602Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.253Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"cluhzew8g004cs7nejpnj8r9u","body":"<p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">The SkillsFuture Level-Up Programme aims to strengthen support for mid-career Singaporeans aged 40 and above to pursue substantive reskilling and upskilling for a career reboot, and to stay relevant amidst a rapidly changing economy.  Under this scheme, Singaporeans aged 40 and above can expect:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">a) A further substantial top-up of the SkillsFuture Credit (SFC);</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">b) Training Allowance to help ease the financial burden for mid-career Singaporeans when they take time off for full-time, long-form training; and</p><p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">c) Support for Singaporeans who already have a publicly-funded diploma or higher qualification to obtain another publicly-funded diploma qualification.<br/>\n </p>","updatedAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.602Z","numPositiveFeedback":0},"topics":[{"id":857,"title":"SkillsFuture Credit","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null},{"id":1466,"title":"Purpose & Objective","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":857,"parentTopic":{"title":"SkillsFuture Credit"}}],"agency":{"code":"skillsfuture","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/skillsfuture.png"}},{"id":"cluhzew8g004ds7neo70wxujq","title":"When will I receive my SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career) Top-Up and when can I start to use it?","body":null,"createdAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.602Z","published":true,"publishedAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.253Z","priority":0,"answer":{"id":"cluhzew8g004es7ne85xb6x6o","body":"<p style=\"margin-left: 40.0px;\">Singaporeans aged 40 and above as of 1 Jan 2024 will receive the SkillsFuture Credit (Mid-Career) top-up by 1 May 2024 and can use it thereafter. <br/>\n </p>","updatedAt":"2024-04-02T06:12:02.602Z","numPositiveFeedback":0},"topics":[{"id":857,"title":"SkillsFuture Credit","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":null,"parentTopic":null},{"id":1466,"title":"Purpose & Objective","priority":0,"agencyId":"clp9ik1v7000d2obpg7545zgg","parentTopicId":857,"parentTopic":{"title":"SkillsFuture Credit"}}],"agency":{"code":"skillsfuture","logoUrl":"https://logos.ask.gov.sg/skillsfuture.png"}},{"id":"cluhzew8g004fs7nefqugzt7e","title":"Is SkillsFuture Credit (SFC) a cash account?
