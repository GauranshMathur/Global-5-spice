# Global 5 Spice

## Overview
Global 5 Spice is a project aimed at fine-tuning OpenAI's GPT model, specifically the Large Language Model (LLM), using data sourced from government Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). By fine-tuning the model with factual information from official government sources, Global 5 Spice aims to enhance the model's ability to generate accurate and informative responses to user queries related to government policies, services, and procedures.

## Features
- **Factual Understanding:** Global 5 Spice is trained on data from government FAQs, enabling it to better understand and generate factual responses to user questions.
- **Specific Domain Knowledge:** The fine-tuning process focuses on a specific domain—government information—allowing the model to specialize in providing accurate answers within this domain.
- **Improved Accuracy:** By fine-tuning on relevant data, Global 5 Spice improves the accuracy and reliability of responses compared to generic language models.
- **Customizable:** Developers can further fine-tune the model or adjust parameters to better suit their specific use cases and requirements.

## Getting Started
To get started with Global 5 Spice, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the Global 5 Spice repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone https://github.com/GauranshMathur/Global-5-Spice.git

2. **Prepare Data:** Gather government FAQs from relevant sources and preprocess the data to ensure compatibility with the fine-tuning process. Organize the FAQs into a suitable format for training.

3. **Fine-Tune the Model:** Use the provided scripts or tools to fine-tune the GPT model on the collected government FAQ data. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to optimize performance.

4. **Evaluate Performance:** Evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance using appropriate metrics and validation datasets. Ensure that the model generates accurate and informative responses to user queries.

5. **Deploy and Integrate:** Deploy the fine-tuned model to your preferred hosting environment and integrate it into your application or platform. Test the integration thoroughly to ensure seamless functionality.
